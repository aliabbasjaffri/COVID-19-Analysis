# COVID-19-Analysis

- An analysis of COVID data released by John Hopkins University. I aim to generate relations between different the growth rate in different countries and spread awareness by way of showing what the rate of spread was in highly infected countries, to countries where the growth is novel.
- Data is being taken from official [JHU Github repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/)
